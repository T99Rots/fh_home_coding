## Flutter test 1

The challenge will be to re-create the design you see here:

[Link to Figma design file](https://www.figma.com/file/F4jegXGvRix0rZbGKYioQz/flutter_test_1).

Pretend that the code you write is part of a large collection of widgets used by several screens and also potentially multiple applications. The code should be well structured, performant, and easy to read and navigate through.

The end result should be a screen matching the look of the design file, and a collection of widgets that make up this screen.

You can assume that the application will be used on larger devices (web, iPad). The buttons do not have to do anything.

Upon completion, please provide a link to the GitHub repository where the code is stored.
