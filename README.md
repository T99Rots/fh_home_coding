## Flutter test 1

The challenge will be to re-create the design you see here:

[Link to Figma design file](https://www.figma.com/file/F4jegXGvRix0rZbGKYioQz/flutter_test_1).

Pretend that the code is part of a large collection of widgets and other components used by several screens and also potentially multiple applications. The code should be well structured, performant, and easy to read and navigate through.

Upon completion, please provide a link to the GitHub repository where the code is stored.
